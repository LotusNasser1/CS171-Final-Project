/**
 * prediction.js - Prediction Utilities Module
 * 
 * This module serves as a placeholder for prediction-related utilities.
 * Currently, all prediction logic is integrated directly into main.js.
 * 
 * This file exists to prevent 404 errors if referenced in HTML includes
 * and can be extended with additional prediction utilities as needed.
 * 
 * See main.js for:
 *   - renderPredictionScreen(): Renders the speedometer prediction UI
 *   - initImprovedSpeedometer(): Handles needle dragging and value updates
 *   - revealImprovedResult(): Animates the reveal of actual mobility data
 *   - animateNeedleToActual(): Smooth needle animation with easing
 *   - showImprovedFeedback(): Displays feedback based on prediction accuracy
 *   - showContextualExplanation(): Shows contextual factors for the result
